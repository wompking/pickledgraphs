# pickledgraphs
A collection of Desmos graphs, pickled with the Desmos Graph Pickler, and saved as images.

To pickle a graph, take the script [here](https://github.com/wompking/pickledgraphs/blob/main/desmospickler.js) and paste it into your browser console on a Desmos page; it will spit out an image data URL that you can paste as an URL into your browser to download the image.

To depickle an image, take the script [here](https://github.com/wompking/pickledgraphs/blob/main/desmosdepickler.js) and paste it into your browser console on a Desmos page; it will prompt you to upload an image and overwrite the graph with the contents of the pickled graph.

No, there's really no reason for this to exist.
If you want to add a graph to the repository, send me the link and I will add it, or you can open a PR with the image you want to add; its name should be the code of the link to the Desmos graph. (the bit after /calculator/)
