# pickledgraphs
A collection of Desmos graphs, pickled with [@Slimrunner](https://github.com/SlimRunner)'s [Desmos Graph Pickler](https://github.com/SlimRunner/desmos-pickler), and saved as images.

No, there's really no reason for this to exist.
If you want to add a graph to the repository, send me the link and I will add it, or you can open a PR with the image you want to add; its name should be the code of the link to the Desmos graph. (the bit after /calculator/)
