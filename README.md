# pickledgraphs
A collection of Desmos graphs, pickled with the as-yet unreleased Desmos Graph Pickler, and saved as images.
No, there's really no reason for this to exist.
If you want to add a graph to the repository, send me the link and I will add it.
If, for some reason, you have access to the Desmos Graph Pickler, open a PR with the image you want to add; its name should be the code of the link to the Desmos graph. (the bit after /calculator/)
